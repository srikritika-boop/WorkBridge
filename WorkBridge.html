            <h3>About our website</h3>
Our website is based off of actual scientific research that indicates that 
<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20823223/"
target="_blank"> more money does'nt mean more happiness in a job.
</a>
Then, what really does matter?
<br>
Research says that there needs to be some 
<a href= "https://humaans.io/hr-glossary/hackman-and-oldham-model"
target="_blank">
"attributes"
</a>
 or some
 <a href="https://selfdeterminationtheory.org/theory/"
 target="_blank">
 "psycological needs" 
 </a>
 that need to be met for someone's mental well-being, and hence, job 
satisfaction. 
<br>
<br>
After going through all of them, we have come to a conclusion of 
<strong>5 core values</strong> that in combination try to explain 
what everyone thinks of when they hear "dream job."

            <h3> The 5 core values</h3>
            # Autonomy- if you're someone who hates being micromanaged and hate rigid structures,
            this might be one of your core values. You would rather be left alone while you work and 
            you like having full control over both your time and your task.
            <br>
            <br>
            # Variety- if you're the type of person that hates routine and would prefer it when 
            things change often, this might be one of your top values.
            <br>
            <br>
            # Alignment- this means how much your job matches with your personal values and sense of 
            identity. For example, if you're the type of person who can't even imagine working for a
            company that goes against your beliefs, then this is one of your core values.
            <br>
            <br>
            # Stability- this means how predictable your job is. If you're the type of person that
            needs to know how your job is going to be like in the next 6 months, or in the long term, 
            then stability might be something you're looking for.
            <br>
            <br>
            # Pay- pay here means how much it matters when compared to all other values. for example,
            if you're the type of person who would choose a better paying job even if it is less flexible,
            or even if it is very monotonous just because you get a better pay in it, then this is one of 
            the major things you might be looking for in a job.
